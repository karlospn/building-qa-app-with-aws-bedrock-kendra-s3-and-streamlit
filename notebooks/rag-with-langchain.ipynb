    "## **1. What are we going to build?**\n",
    "\n",
    "We have two options for enabling a LLM to understand and answer our private domain-specific questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fine-tune the LLM on text data covering the topic mentioned.\n",
    "- Using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), a technique that implements an information retrieval component to the generation process. Allowing us to retrieve relevant information and feed this information into the generation model as a secondary source of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I will show you how to use the pattern of Retrieval Augmented Generation Question Answering using AWS Kendra, AWS S3 and AWS Bedrock.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following diagram shows what we're going build:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The private documents, about which we want to ask questions, are stored in an S3 bucket.\n",
    "- We have a Kendra Index with a connector to the S3 bucket. The Index checks the s3 bucket every N minutes for new content. If new content is found in the bucket, it gets automatically parsed and stored into Kendra database. \n",
    "- The Jupyter notebook, given a specific question, retrieves the most relevant documents from Kendra, assembles a prompt with the extracted information from Kendra, and sends it to one of the multiple avaiable LLMs in AWS Bedrock.\n",
    "\n",
    "![diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlospn/building-qa-app-with-aws-bedrock-kendra-s3-and-streamlit/main/docs/aws-architecture-jupyter-notebook-langchain.png)\n",

    "\n",
    "## **2. Deploying an AWS Kendra index with an S3 connector and store documents on it**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the ``/infra`` folder, you'll find a series of Terraform files that will create everything you'll need.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Terraform files will create the following resources:\n",
    "- An s3 bucket with our private docs on it.\n",
    "- A Kendra index with an s3 connector.\n",
    "- An IAM role with the required permissions to make everything work.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Building the RAG pattern using LangChain**\n",
    "\n",
    "[LangChain](https://python.langchain.com) is a Python library that streamlines the process of creating a RAG pattern with AWS Bedrock and Kendra. It offers a set of abstractions that simplifies every essential step of the RAG workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't want to use a third party library like ``LangChain``, go take a look at my other Jupyther Notebook: ``rag-with-only-boto3``.    \n",
    "In there, I will show you how to build the exact same RAG pattern but using only ``boto3``.\n"
