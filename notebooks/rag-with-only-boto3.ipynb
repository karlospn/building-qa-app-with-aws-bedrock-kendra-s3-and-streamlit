    "We have two options for enabling a LLM to understand and answer our private domain-specific questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fine-tune the LLM on text data covering the topic mentioned.\n",
    "- Using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), a technique that implements an information retrieval component to the generation process. Allowing us to retrieve relevant information and feed this information into the generation model as a secondary source of information.\n",

    "In this notebook, I will show you how to use the pattern of Retrieval Augmented Generation Question Answering using AWS Kendra, AWS S3 and AWS Bedrock.\n",

    "The following diagram shows what we're going build:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The private documents, about which we want to ask questions, are stored in an S3 bucket.\n",
    "- We have a Kendra Index with a connector to the S3 bucket. The Index checks the s3 bucket every N minutes for new content. If new content is found in the bucket, it gets automatically parsed and stored into Kendra database. \n",
    "- The Jupyter notebook, given a specific question, retrieves the most relevant paragraphs from Kendra, assembles a prompt with the extracted information from Kendra, and sends it to one of the multiple available LLMs in AWS Bedrock.\n",

      "Typed Clients with IHttpClientFactory This diagram shows the following steps: 1. Services that need to make outgoing HTTP calls are configured to depend on an injected IHttpClientFactory. 2. At startup, the services that need clients register Typed Clients using IHttpClientFactory. 3. The configuration information is added, including base address, policies, and any other information. 4. When the service needs an HttpClient, it calls CreateClient on the factory interface. 5. The factory returns an HttpClient instance matching the registration. Notice how each Typed Client has configuration information and a name associated with it. The configuration information could include policies for that client, a base address, default headers, and so on. Using Typed Clients promotes reuse by consolidating the HttpClient configuration in one place. This consolidation can: • Reduce complexity in the app by encapsulating HttpClient configuration within IHttpClientFactory. • Standardize how HttpClients are configured. • Codify patterns that are specific to each microservice. For example, a client that calls an external weather API might be different than one that calls an internal user management API. Implementation details The implementation is simple but does require a few steps: 1. Register Typed Clients during app startup in ConfigureServices. 2. Configure HttpClientPolicies. 3. Inject IHttpClientFactory into your constructor. 4. Use Typed Client name to call CreateClient on the factory. The following example shows how to: • Register two Typed Clients (“ServiceA” and “ServiceB”). • Configure the base address and policies for each client. • Inject IHttpClientFactory into a service. • Use the Typed Clients by asking for them from the factory.\n",
      "So in summary:\n",
      "- IHttpClientFactory provides a central location for configuring and creating HttpClient instances. This can help avoid issues with managing many HttpClient instances.\n",
      "- It allows registering and configuring typed clients (named HttpClient instances). This provides a clean way to reuse and share HttpClient configurations across an app.\n",
      "\n",
      "- It integrates with Polly, allowing easy use of Polly resilience policies like retry, circuit breakers, etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "- Overall, it provides a cleaner and more robust way to use HttpClient in an app compared to creating HttpClient instances directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the main benefits are:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Central configuration\n",
      "- Reuse of HttpClient setup/config \n",
      "- Easy to use Polly policies\n",
      "- Avoid issues with managing many HttpClient instances\n",
