    "## **1. What are we going to build?**\n",
    "\n",
    "We have two options for enabling a LLM to understand and answer our private domain-specific questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fine-tune the LLM on text data covering the topic mentioned.\n",
    "- Using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), a technique that implements an information retrieval component to the generation process. Allowing us to retrieve relevant information and feed this information into the generation model as a secondary source of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I will show you how to use the pattern of Retrieval Augmented Generation Question Answering using AWS Kendra, AWS S3 and AWS Bedrock.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following diagram shows what we're going build:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The private documents, about which we want to ask questions, are stored in an S3 bucket.\n",
    "- We have a Kendra Index with a connector to the S3 bucket. The Index checks the s3 bucket every N minutes for new content. If new content is found in the bucket, it gets automatically parsed and stored into Kendra database. \n",
    "- The Jupyter notebook, given a specific question, retrieves the most relevant paragraphs from Kendra, assembles a prompt with the extracted information from Kendra, and sends it to one of the multiple available LLMs in AWS Bedrock.\n",
    "\n",
    "![diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlospn/building-qa-app-with-aws-bedrock-kendra-s3-and-streamlit/main/docs/aws-architecture-jupyter-notebook.png)\n",

    "\n",
    "## **2. Deploying an AWS Kendra index with an S3 connector and store documents on it**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the ``/infra`` folder, you'll find a series of Terraform files that will create everything you'll need.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Terraform files will create the following resources:\n",
    "- An s3 bucket with our private docs on it.\n",
    "- A Kendra index with an s3 connector.\n",
    "- An IAM role with the required permissions to make everything work.\n",
    "\n",

    "## **3. Building the RAG pattern using boto3**\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to use the ``boto3`` library to interact with AWS Kendra and AWS Bedrock.\n",
    "\n",
    "[LangChain](https://python.langchain.com) streamlines the process of creating a RAG pattern on AWS quite a bit.     \n",
    "If you want to see how to build exactly the same RAG pattern, but this time using ``LangChain`` instead of ``boto3``, go take a look at my other Jupyther Notebook: ``rag-with-langchain``.\n"

Benefits of using IHttpClientFactory The current implementation of IHttpClientFactory, that also implements IHttpMessageHandlerFactory, offers the following benefits: • Provides a central location for naming and configuring logical HttpClient objects. For example, you may configure a client (Service Agent) that’s pre-configured to access a specific microservice. • Codify the concept of outgoing middleware via delegating handlers in HttpClient and implementing Polly-based middleware to take advantage of Polly’s policies for resiliency. • HttpClient already has the concept of delegating handlers that could be linked together for outgoing HTTP requests.
